<p>hi there, this is just a little project where I try to display all the Javascript data types</p>
<h1>String</h1>
<p>strings are basically just a series of text characters. They're denoted with single or double quotes. As in, 'potato' or "potato"</p>
<script>
    text = "potato"
    return text
</script>
