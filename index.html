    <title>Javascript Data Types</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>hi there, this is just a little project where I try to display all the Javascript data types</p>

<h1>String</h1>
<p>Strings are basically just a series of text characters. They're denoted with single or double quotes. As in, 'potato' or "potato"</p>
<p>The following text should return a string:</p>
<h2 id="demo-1"></h2>
<script>
    const text = "potato";
    document.getElementById("demo-1").innerText = text;
</script>

<h1>Number</h1>
<p>Javascript numbers are stored in double-precision (64-bit floating point) format. In practice this means it has 15-16 decimal digits of precision</p>
<p>You can do math with Javascript numbers using operators</p>
<p>The following is some math I've done with Javascript operators</p>
<h2 id="demo-2"></h2>
<script>
    const num1 = 5;
    const num2 = 3;
    document.getElementById("demo-2").innerText = num1 + num2;
</script>

<h1>BigInt</h1>
<p>BigInt is a format for storing big integers beyond what can normally be handled by typical double-precision 64-bit floating point numbers.</p>
<p>This should be an example of a BigInt</p>
<h2 id="demo-3"></h2>
<script>
    bigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740992);
    document.getElementById("demo-3").innerText = bigNumber + " " + "(this is basically 1 greater than the biggest safe integer you can use with regular javascript numbers)";
</script>

<h1>Boolean</h1>
<p>Boolean values are either true or false. Not like, the string "true" or "false". The values are just true or false.</p>
<p>I think you mostly use this value when you do comparisons and check for conditions - which will result in either a TRUE or FALSE value.</p>
<p>The following should be a little comparison that results in a boolean value being output. Is 3 < 8?</p>
<h2 id="demo-4"></h2>
<script>
    isThreeLessThanEight = (3 < 8)
    document.getElementById("demo-4").innerText = isThreeLessThanEight
</script>

<h1>Undefined</h1>
<p>A variable with no value has a value of undefined. The data type is also undefined.</p>
<p>undefined is not to be confused with (1) null, or (2) an empty string (which has a value of "" and a type of "string")</p>
<p>The following should display a variable with a value of undefined</p>
<h2 id="demo-5"></h2>
<script>
    let undefinedVariable
    document.getElementById("demo-5").innerText = undefinedVariable
</script>

<h1>Null</h1>
<p>null and undefined both represent the absence of a value, but null represents the intentional absence of a value, whereas undefined denotes that a variable has been declared, but not assigned a value yet (or the variable has not been declared at all!).</p>
<p>an example of how a null value could come about is if you're using the .match method on a string with some Regular Expressions (regex), and the string doesn't match any of the regex criteria.</p>
<p>here's an example of that which should display a null value</p>
<script>
    function getVowels(str) {
        const m = str.match(/[aeiou]/gi);
        return m;
    }
    getVowels("why")
</script>
<h2 id="demo-6"></h2>
<script>
    // this is a test to see if document.getElementById().innerText would display a null value as "null", or an empty field.
    document.getElementById("demo-6").innerText = null
</script>
<h2>Haha, this is not a null value. Turns out if there's no value... there's nothing to display!</h2>
</body>

<h1>Symbol</h1>
<p>bruh the definition baffles me. Basically what I understand is that you use this Symbol() constructor that creates a unique value</p>
<p>e.g. Symbol("foo") === Symbol("foo") // returns false</p>
<p>I read that this is good for "adding unique property keys to an object that won't collide with other keys any other code might add to that object", but I have no idea what that means yet.</p>

<h1>Object</h1>
<p>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces { }.</p>
<p>Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</p>
<p>Basically it seems like you can create a thing, and assign it different properties.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what a coffee object might look like:</p>
<p>const coffee = {countryOfOrigin:"Brazil", variety:"Yellow Bourbon", roastLevel:"medium-dark"}</p>
<p>and this is an example of calling on its properties:</p>
<p id="demo-7"></p>
<p id="demo-8"></p>
<p id="demo-9"></p>
<script>
    const coffee = {countryOfOrigin:"Brazil", variety:"Yellow Bourbon", roastLevel:"medium-dark"}
    document.getElementById("demo-7").innerText = coffee.countryOfOrigin
    document.getElementById("demo-8").innerText = coffee.variety
    document.getElementById("demo-9").innerText = coffee.roastLevel
</script>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>Arrays are special objects. They are basically ordered lists of values where each value is accessible by its numerical index</p>
    <p>Arrays are represented by square brackets, with the items within separated by columns. Here's what an array looks like:</p>
    <p>fruits = ["apples", "pears", "mangoes"]</p>
    <p>So fruits[0] would be "apples"</p>

    <h2>Dates</h2>
    <p>JavaScript Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format. Date objects encapsulate an integral number that represents milliseconds since the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC (the epoch).</p>
    <p>This is an example of using a Date() constructor with multiple arguments to display an arbitrary time (I wonder what timezone this is going to come out as, actually. Apparently it should be in local time, but like, my local time? my website host's local time? Or the viewer's local time?)</p>
    <h3 id="demo-10"></h3>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo-10").innerText = Date(2025,6,18,22,59,0,11)
    </script>

<h1>Concluding Words</h1>
<p>That's it for now, I guess. Hope this works.</p>
