<p>hi there, this is just a little project where I try to display all the Javascript data types</p>
<h1>String</h1>
<p>Strings are basically just a series of text characters. They're denoted with single or double quotes. As in, 'potato' or "potato"</p>
<p>The following text should return a string:</p>
<script>
    text = "potato"
    return text
</script>
<h1>Number</h1>
<p>Javascript numbers are stored in double-precision (64-bit floating point) format. In practice this means it has 15-16 decimal digits of precision</p>
<p>You can do math with Javascript numbers using operators</p>
<p>The following is some math I've done with Javascript operators</p>
<script>
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 3
    return num1 + num2
</script>
</body>
